This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener: a delay in triggering after successful authentication. The `delayedAuth.js` file showcases the problem, where actions dependent on authentication might fail because the listener hasn't yet updated the state.  `delayedAuthSolution.js` provides a solution using a promise to ensure authentication state is checked before proceeding.
